"""Abstract base class for CA backends.

All CA backends (built-in and custom) must inherit from
:class:`CABackend` and implement :meth:`sign` and :meth:`revoke`.

The ``sign`` method receives a parsed CSR, a certificate profile,
validity parameters, and an optional serial number, and returns an
:class:`IssuedCertificate` containing the PEM chain and metadata.

The ``revoke`` method notifies the backend of a revocation — this is
called *after* the database record has been updated, allowing backends
to propagate the event (e.g. to an external CA or CRL publisher).
